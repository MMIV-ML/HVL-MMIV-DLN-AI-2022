Recent years have seen a surge of interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is caused by highly visible breakthroughs in a variety of areas like computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition and synthesis, and in the analysis of unstructured, tabular data. As many of the challenges faced in more general domains are transferable to specialized domains, we have seen a torrent of scientific publications and new applications across all data-driven fields, from medicine to physics, biology to cosmology. The course provides a practical, project-based, hands-on exploration of state-of-the-art techniques and software frameworks from machine learning and deep learning for solving real-world problems from biomedicine, biotech and related fields. It will be a guided tour of a useful, interesting and important landscape, pointing out theoretical and application-oriented gold-mines along the way. 

By the end of the course the participants will have a solid understanding of the ideas of machine learning, and good experience and practical intuitions around how the methods can be applied in biomedical domains, using modern tools and frameworks. They'll also be familiar with some challenges and limitations of applied machine learning.
