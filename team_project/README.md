# _Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach_



## Description
Imagine that you are a group of established successful scientists that will team up to tackle an important biomedical and medical challenge. There is an open call for research proposals under a new umbrella program entitled _“Artificial intelligence and computational (bio)medicine”_, where your multidisciplinary group are aiming for a project entitled

> “Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach”

The focus of the assignment is fivefold:

1. description of relevant imaging technologies and modalities - possibly at different scales e.g. from IMC to MRI and combined with omics data
2. proposal of imaging-derived biomarkers for glioblastoma,
3. machine learning techniques for segmentation, classification, treatment stratification and prediction, or other relevant applications
4. the novelty and expected impact of your approach and corresponding evaluation criteria, and
5. a discussion of the ethics of your project together with a data management plan (and not so much the basic science of brain tumors per se).


## Organization of your report

### Research plan
(3-5 pages incl. figures and bibliography)
 - A brief background to the field
 - Objectives and expected impact
 - Material and methods
 - Evaluation criteria

### Data management plan and ethical considerations
(1 1/2-2 1/2 pages incl. graphics / links)
 - Description of generated data and code
 - Sharing of data and code

*Excerpt*: Considering the value of big data and the potential of publicly available datasets for increased reproducibility of scientific findings, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created TCGA ([cancergenome.nih.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)) and [TCIA](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7) (www.cancerimagingarchive.net). TCGA is a multi-institutional comprehensive collection of various molecularly characterized tumor types, and its data are available in NCI’s Genomic Data Commons portal ([gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov)). Building upon NIH’s investment in TCGA, the NCI’s Cancer Imaging Program approached sites that contributed tissue samples, to obtain corresponding de-identified routine clinically-acquired radiological data and store them in TCIA. These repositories make available multi-institutional, high-dimensional, multi-parametric data of cancer patients, allowing for radiogenomic analysis.
